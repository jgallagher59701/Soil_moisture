What's here

For each of these tests, the receiver was at Mt Fleecer, GLORIA
project tree-line summit and the senders (nodes 1, 2, and 3) were at
the tree-line west locataion. The fleecer_test_N.txt files are the
information captured by the receiver and the Data{19,20}.csv files are
from the node 1 SD card.

Test 1

Temp/humidity sensor (SHT-30D) buried ~5-10cm
Recorded data. in fleecer_test_1.txt and in Data19.csv (from sender 1
SD card).

Test 2
Buried the senders too. I think node 1 had a short - it might have
been stepped on - but data from node 1 was not received when I get
back to the laptop. Data from the receier are in fleecer_test_2.txt
and probably Data19.csv

Test 3
Reburied node 1. Saved data in fleecer_test_3.txt and
fleecer_test_4.txt and in Data20.csv (I'm pretty sure the node was
restarted).

Test 4
Moved the receiver from it's locataion on the ground to a tree ~3 ft
off the ground. Nodes 1-3 still buiried and kept on sending. Data
saved in fleecer_test_5.txt and Data20.csv.

Test 5
Just lets things run for a while - ~10 mins. Data in
fleecer_test_6.txt and Data20.csv.
