Data from trials at Mt Keokirk, 7/18/20. For these trials, nodes 2 and 3
were buried in about 2-4 inches of dirt (about the same depth as the Hobo
TidBit loggers are now buried).

Node 1 was not buried. It used the Adafruit LoRa breakout board, which
uses the SX1276. Node 2 was buried and also used the Adafruit/SX1276.
Node 3 was buried at the same location as Node 2, but used a cheaper
HopeRF 95 LoRa board.

For these trials, the server/receiver was also an ATMega328 and the
LoRa at HopeRF board. The LoRa returned hex values for the packet in
addition to the ASCII version of the payload. Those raw files are in
'raw' and trimmed versions that shows only the ASCII payload are here.

The server was not buried.

Data in raw were captured in the field. Data in raw2 are somewhat
cooked values. Data here in keokirk-node-N-7.18.20.txt are separated
values for the three nodes.
