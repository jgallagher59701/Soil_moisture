Data from trials at Mt Keokirk, 7/18/20. For these trials, nodes 2 and 3
were buried in about 2-4 inches of dirt (about the same depth as the Hobo
TidBit loggers are now buried).

For these trials, the server was also an ATMega328 and the LoRa at HopeRF
board. The LoRa returned hex values for the packet in addition to the ASCII
version of the payload. Those raw files are in 'raw' and trimmed versions
that shows only the ASCII payload are here.
